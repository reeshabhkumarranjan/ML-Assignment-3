Do not change directory structure.
Run the python file in first problem in terminal.
Second problem's python file must be run on Google Colab.
I have referred to https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#define-a-convolutional-neural-network for second problem.
The theory question is attached as pdf.
Weights are in the weights/ directory and plots are in plots/ directory. Data is in images/ directory.
